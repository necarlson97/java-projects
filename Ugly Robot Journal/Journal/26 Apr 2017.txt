Day two, take #3 on writing this... Hard balance on being aggresive with trimming unneccicary data from these files, and then accedentally deleteing too much. Too bad I don't feel like writing down my deleted thoughts again lol! Lost to the sands of time, or now, the CPU ticks of time.

Still much to do, with this program (moving curser index in text) and much to do in life (finishing up spring semester 2017). Im off to do those things!
