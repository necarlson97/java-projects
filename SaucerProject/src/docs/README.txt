CS121 Project 7
The assignment will be posted in OWL shortly. Until then, get started now on the project.

First, read the file: CS121 The Saucer Game Project.pdf

For this assignment you will be provided with the SaucerDriver, DisplayWindow, and a starting version of the SaucerPanel class files.
You will complete the SaucerPanel code for this assignment.
NOTE: You may NOT alter any other part of the code.

TODO list for the SaucerPanel code:

    Complete the actionPerformed method: (70%)

        If one of the directional buttons is clicked, set the direction value and
        start the timer if it isn't already running.
        If the event was generated by the timer, move the saucer in the appropriate direction by adding the saucerMoveIncrement to the current saucer position.
        Of course you must check that the saucer is in bounds after the move is made.

    Add a reset button called resetBtn to the GUI so that the game starts over when it is clicked. (30%)



Submit your SaucerPanel code to the Project 7 assignment in OWL when it has been posted (you will be notified).
