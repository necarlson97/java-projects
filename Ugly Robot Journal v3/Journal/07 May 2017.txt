Well sorry for not checking back in a few days... Honestly I'm not sure Im done iterating on this project yet, but if I intend to use this as an actualy journal, I should export it and plot it on the desktop...

Currently I'm making the 'image to ascii' thingy, with fullscreen switching on the fly! I really love programming, and all these dorky dumb projects give me a suprising amount of satisfaction...

Watched 'the heathers' today with amanda (and syd robenson). What an amazing film, dramatic comedy gold. I mean, bizzare, and almost un-ironic to a falt, but it really manedges to pull of that "serious-not-serious" in the end...

Hmm anything else? Playing my fucking brains out on breadth of the wild. As dumb as it may sound, I am really starting to appreciate the potential games have to be, like, the best medium for art. Maybe that should be my next project! I'll have to think about that...
