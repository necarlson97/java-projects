Hey, actualy doing a journal entry at a proper time of day! Currently chilling in emily and amanda's dorm in baker. The party folks (Marc M, Mike D, Megan W, Brooke S, Amanda S) are going to a 'meme' party, if you can believe it. 

I think the rasberry pi zero may not run this, haha! I mean, just gives me a reason to get a pi 2 or 3! We will see what ebay has, possibly. I'm hoping to find an old 70s kitchen tv at goodwill. Everything moves in slow motion though, never know how much I'm willing to spend (I mean, unemployed currently, so...)

Idk idk, maybe I'll start tring to kick the emotional level of this journal up a notch, as it gets fleshed out more...
