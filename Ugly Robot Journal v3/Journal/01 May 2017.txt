Sittn here listening to the prophet kendrick lammar, watching brooke play breath of the wild. Just finished making the web dev 'jeeves' project video, half the team flaked right at the end and I got left with a chunk of work (and we still only really make a lackluster project) but hey, I make a video, and worked a bunch, so I feel fine.

The weather is beautiful, light steamy rain. Im exited for this summer, exited for my job teaching java via minecraft mods, exited for swimming with brooke in puffers pond, exited for lazy videogame days and programming and electonics. I'm living the good life.

I really love brooke, she makes me feel very secure and safe.
As the stress lifts from the semester comming to end, I got to appreciate all that I have!
