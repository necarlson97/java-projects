Just waking up now to bring brooke to her last exam, but I wanted to record my dream real quick.

It was voting season again, and this election cycle we had and even more unorthadox selection of presedential candidates than in 2016. So crazy was this line-up in fact, none of them were human! The most popular candidate was an eldritch slug, an ancient creatureof untold power. He was about the size of a large dog, a sandy green-ish color, he wears a white mast in an :o expression, and has never spoken. I think he can also control lightning and peoples minds or something.
The second most popular candidate was... another eldritch slug. In fact, all the candidates were eldritch slugs, with slighly differen shades of sandy green skin, and slightly different masks.
Despite their apparant simmilarities, the populace was even more torn in 2016, and there was even an assasination attemp, where people rushed a candidate to try to throw him into a fire. He did nothing to stop them, but he also did not burn, resisting the fire completly.
Most of the dream consisted with me chatting some aqquatences from my CS classes as they contemplate all the ways they could use their networking knowledge to righ the electronic voting booths in favor of their slug of choice.
